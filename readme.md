🛒 E-Commerce Analytics using MySQL

📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing an E-Commerce transactional dataset using MySQL to uncover actionable business insights related to customer behavior, conversion efficiency, retention, and revenue performance.

The analysis simulates real-world business questions faced by e-commerce companies and demonstrates how SQL can be used to drive data-backed decision-making.

🎯 Business Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

Analyze the customer purchase funnel and identify drop-off points

Measure key business KPIs such as conversion rate, AOV, and repeat purchase rate

Perform cohort analysis to understand customer retention over time

Segment customers using RFM analysis to identify high-value users

Provide insights that can increase revenue and customer retention

❓ Business Problems Solved

1️⃣ Funnel Bottleneck Identification

E-commerce platforms often lose a significant portion of users before purchase. This project identifies exact funnel stages where users abandon, helping businesses optimize UX and checkout flow.

2️⃣ Customer Retention & Cohort Behavior

Understanding how long customers stay active after their first purchase is critical. Cohort analysis reveals retention decay patterns over time.

3️⃣ KPI-Driven Performance Tracking

Stakeholders need measurable indicators of business health. This project calculates core KPIs that directly reflect sales and customer engagement performance.

4️⃣ Customer Value Segmentation (RFM)

Not all customers contribute equally. RFM segmentation categorizes users into high-value, loyal, at-risk, and low-value segments for targeted marketing.
