## 📌 Overview

This project performs **end-to-end E-Commerce data analysis using MySQL**, focusing on **customer behavior, sales performance, conversion efficiency, and retention trends**.

The goal is to demonstrate how **structured SQL analysis** can solve real-world business problems and generate **actionable insights that drive revenue growth and customer retention**.

---

## 🎯 Business Objectives

- Identify **conversion funnel bottlenecks**
- Measure **core business KPIs**
- Analyze **customer retention using cohort analysis**
- Segment customers using **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)**
- Enable **data-driven business decision-making**

---

## ❓ Problem Statements Addressed

### 🔹 Funnel Performance
E-commerce platforms often experience high user drop-offs before purchase.  
This project identifies **exact funnel stages where abandonment occurs** and quantifies their business impact.

### 🔹 Customer Retention
Understanding customer longevity is critical for sustainable growth.  
Cohort analysis highlights **retention decay patterns over time**.

### 🔹 KPI Visibility
Businesses need measurable indicators of performance.  
This project computes **conversion rate, AOV, repeat purchase rate**, and other key metrics.

### 🔹 Customer Value Segmentation
Not all customers contribute equally to revenue.  
RFM segmentation categorizes users into **high-value, loyal, at-risk, and low-value segments**.
